# Important update
This project is a forked version of IdentityServer4 as taken from the archive when .NET Core 3.1 end of support was reached (13th Dec 2022). All new development in support of .NET 7 is happening here. 

** Pull requests are welcome **

## Roadmap
Fix broken tests associated with any of the solutions. Those that are apart of IdentityServer4.sln do run.
Rebrand as OpenIdentity or the like. 
Distribute via official channels (eg nuget.org)
